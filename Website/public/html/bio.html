                        <p>I didn’t even know what a clarinet was until the moment I decided to play it. In the 4th grade,
                            I was shown a demonstrative video of wind instruments as part of an effort to recruit students to the band.
                            One line caught my attention: “the clarinet has the widest range of all woodwinds.”
                            Something about being able to play more notes than everyone else appealed to me, and I’ve stuck
                            with the clarinet ever since. I don’t think I was particularly good at it early on; I was
                            also playing piano and viola then, and I lacked the time and dedication to perfect all of
                            them. It didn’t help that an amateur clarinet sound is positively hideous, and practicing it
                            came at the expense of my family’s sanity. With persistence, however, I found that I
                            could produce incredible timbres and overtones unique to the clarinet. The rich,
                            chocolatey texture is probably what I love most about the instrument.</p>

                        <p>I have two people to thank: my clarinet teacher, Jessica Popik, and my middle school band director,
                            Karen Forrest. These mentors encouraged me to push my boundaries to the limit, and I
                            wouldn’t be where I am today without them.</p>

                    <p>I have participated in the Central District Music Festival since 7th grade and was fortunate enough to be a part
                        of the Massachusetts All-State festival in my freshman year: one of my most memorable experiences to date. The guest
                        conductor, <a href="https://www.hartford.edu/directory/hartt/adsit-glen.aspx">Glen Adsit</a>, was a truly charismatic
                        person; he touched every one of the 100+ musicians
                        in the hall with his enthusiasm and cultivated a sense of community between us. He was particularly fond of a composer friend of his,
                        David Maslanka, the music of whom helped him develop a deeper sense of spirituality during his battle with cancer. Adsit
                        had the opportunity to meet personally with Maslanka, and he recovered from his illness soon afterward. Our closing
                        piece, as he informed us, was a token of gratitude and a tribute to his friend’s death.
                    </p>
                    <p>We performed at Symphony Hall after 3 consecutive days of nonstop practice. Seeing Prof. Adsit cut off the final chord of 
                        Maslanka’s “Give Us This Day” gave me a profound feeling of exhilaration that I doubt I will ever recreate. I 
                        returned to the All-State Festival again in sophomore year, but the virtual experience was nowhere near as exciting as the
                        real thing.</p>

                        <p> I played in the <a href="https://www.claflinhill.com/home">Claflin Hill Youth Wind Ensemble</a> from 2017-2020. 
                            I was generously offered a seat on my first
                            audition by the director, Paul Surapine, who evidently believed he could “whip me into shape”—for lack of a 
                            better term. The experience was uncharted territory for me: the expectations were high, the music was difficult,
                            and the other musicians were several heads taller than me. Admittedly, I was quite lost for the entire first 
                            year. I struggled to play through tough passages despite practicing for hours, while the rest of my section 
                            seemingly breezed through entire pieces on the first read. The concertmaster was particularly formidable—his
                            technique and intonation were unmatched, and he served as a role model for me. </p>
                        
                            <p>Claflin showed me a beauty in music that I had never encountered in the cacophony known as middle school band.
                                I used to believe that music was a procedure: a methodical practice in which playing the right notes and rhythms 
                                corresponded to checked boxes on a rubric. After joining CHYS, I practiced so that I might play like the concertmaster 
                                whom I looked up to so intently. I grew rapidly, and in my third year I rose to take the 1st chair after my idol graduated.</p>

                    <h2>Discovering a New World</h2>
                    <p>I was first introduced to machine learning in a weeklong course over the summer of 7th grade. To be frank, it was rather poorly taught; 
                        I essentially learned to copy a computer vision program from a board with no understanding of how or why the code works 
                        (it was also written in TensorFlow 1.x. Blasphemous, right?). But the concept of making world-changing applications without
                        needing materials or a lab was appealing to me, and harnessing that power became an obsession. </p>

                        <p>The code was written in Python, and I had a limited understanding of the language. To practice, I started making scripts to
                            solve problems I encountered in school, searching up concepts on the Internet when I needed to expand my toolkit. Looking back
                            at the code I wrote back then, I laugh at its naivety (it was also written in Azure Notebooks... nostalgic). But it was all
                            part of the learning process, and every project gave me valuable experience. By the start of my freshman year, I could solve
                            problems that I never dreamed of approaching previously. </p>


                        <p>With a newfound understanding of Python, I revisited the code I wrote years ago. Its syntax made sense to me now; it was
                            speaking my language. However, I still didn't understand how the neural network actually 'learns'. Theoretical machine learning
                            – the fundamental math that drives A.I algorithms – was my next pursuit. But upon glancing at the equations, I realized that
                            I understood very little of them; they were deeply rooted in calculus and linear algebra. I never really had a passion for math,
                            but learning these concepts was a necessary next step. I picked up just enough to re-derive each of the equations with meticulous 
                            practice and some help from the internet.</p>
                        
                        <p>Equipped with this knowledge, I managed to build a trainable CNN from scratch, deriving all of the forward and backward-pass algorithms
                            for gradient descent by hand. I pondered for hours on how to approach this problem, and I spent orders of magnitude more time debugging
                            the code. The joy that I felt when the model finished training with 98% test accuracy on the MNIST dataset is indescribable.</p>

                        <p>I have a much better grasp of machine learning today than I did 4 years ago, and I smile at the progress I’ve made since then.
                            I wouldn’t say I’m an expert; there's so much I have yet to learn. But every step I take brings my goal closer in sight.</p>
