                        Westborough at the beginning of elementary school and have been
                        living there ever since. </h2>

                        <h2>My Origin Story</h2>
                        <p>I didn’t even know what a clarinet was until the moment I decided to play it. In 4th grade,
                            the elementary school band director showed us a video demonstrating every band instrument.
                            One line caught my attention: “the clarinet has the widest range of all wind instruments.”
                            Something about being able to play more notes than everyone else appealed to me, and I’ve stuck
                            with the instrument ever since. I don’t think I was particularly good at it early on; I was
                            also playing piano and viola then, and I lacked the time and resolve to perfect all of
                            them. It didn’t help that an amateur clarinet sound is positively hideous, and practicing it
                            came at the expense of my family’s sanity. With persistence, however, I found that I
                            was capable of producing incredible timbres and overtones unique to the clarinet. The rich,
                            chocolatey texture is probably what I love most about the instrument.</p>

                        <p>I have two people to thank: my clarinet teacher, Jessica Popik, and my middle school band director,
                            Karen Forrest. These mentors encouraged me to push my boundaries to the limit, and I
                            wouldn’t be where I am today without them.</p>

                    <h2>Districts and All State</h2>
                    <p>I have participated in the Central District Music Festival since 7th grade, and I was fortunate enough to be a part
                        of the Massachusetts All-State festival in my freshman year: one of my most memorable experiences to date. The guest
                        conductor, <a href="https://www.hartford.edu/directory/hartt/adsit-glen.aspx">Glen Adsit</a>, was a truly charismatic
                        person; his enthusiasm rippled across every one of the 100+ musicians
                        in the hall, and he cultivated a sense of community between us. He was particularly fond of a composer friend of his,
                        David Maslanka, whose music helped him develop a deeper sense of spirituality during his battle with cancer. Adsit
                        had an opportunity to meet personally with Maslanka, and he recovered from his illness soon afterward. Our closing
                        piece, as he informed us, was a token of gratitude and a tribute to his friend’s death.
                    </p>
                    <p>We performed at Symphony Hall after 3 consecutive days of nonstop practice. Seeing Prof. Adsit cut off the final chord of 
                        Maslanka’s “Give Us This Day” gave me a feeling of exhilaration that I don’t think I’ll ever be able to recreate. I 
                        returned to the All-State Festival again in sophomore year, but the virtual experience was nowhere near as exciting as the
                        real thing.</p>

                        <h2>Claflin Hill</h2>
                        <p> I played in the Claflin Hill Youth Wind Ensemble from 2017-2020. I was generously offered a seat on my first 
                            audition by the director, Paul Surapine, who evidently believed he could “whip me into shape”—for lack of a 
                            better term. The experience was uncharted territory for me: the expectations were high, the music was difficult,
                            and the other musicians were several heads taller than me. Admittedly, I was quite lost for the entire first 
                            year. I struggled to play through tough passages despite practicing for hours, while the rest of my section 
                            seemingly breezed through entire pieces on the first read. The concertmaster was particularly formidable—his
                            technique and intonation were unmatched, and he served as a role model for me. </p>

                    <h2>Discovering a New World</h2>
                    <p>I was first introduced to machine learning in a weeklong course over the summer of 7th grade. To be frank, it was rather poorly taught; 
                        I essentially learned to copy a computer vision program from a board with no understanding of how or why the code works 
                        (it was also written in TensorFlow 1.x. Blasphemous, right?). But the concept of making world-changing applications without
                        needing materials or a lab was appealing to me, and harnessing that power became an obsession. </p>

                        <p>The code was written in Python, and I had a limited understanding of the language. To prac   tice, I started making scripts to
                            solve problems I encountered in school, searching things up on the Internet when I needed to expand my toolkit. Looking back
                            at the code I wrote back in 8th grade, I laugh at its naivety (and it was written in Azure Notebooks… pfft). But it was all
                            a part of the learning process, and each project deepened my understanding. By the start of my freshman year, I could solve
                            problems that I never dreamed of solving previously. </p>


                        <p>With a newfound understanding of Python, I revisited the code I wrote years ago. Its syntax made sense to me now; it was
                            speaking my language. However, I still didn't understand how the neural network actually 'learns'. Theoretical machine learning
                            – the fundamental math that drives A.I algorithms – was my next pursuit. But upon glancing at the equations, I realized that
                            I understood very little of them; they were deeply rooted in calculus and linear algebra. I never really had a passion for math,
                            but learning these concepts was a necessary next step. I picked up just enough to re-derive each of the equations with meticulous 
                            practice and some help from the internet.</p>
                        
                        <p>Equipped this knowledge, I managed to build a trainable CNN from scratch, deriving all of the forward-pass and backward-pass algorithms
                            for gradient descent by hand. I pondered for hours on how to approach this problem, and I spent orders of magnitude more time debugging
                            the code. The joy that I felt when the model finished training with 98% test accuracy on the MNIST dataset is indescribable.</p>

                        <p>Today, I have a much better grasp of machine learning than I did 4 years ago, and I smile at the progress I’ve made since then.
                            I wouldn’t say I’m an expert-I wouldn’t even say I’m proficient, but I would say that every step brings my goal closer in sight.
