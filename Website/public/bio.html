                        <h2>My Origin Story</h2>
                        <p>
                            I didn’t even know what a clarinet was until the moment I decided to play it. In 4th grade,
                             the elementary school band director showed us a video demonstrating every band instrument.
                             One line caught my attention: “the clarinet has the widest range of all wind instruments.”
                             Something about being able to play more notes than everyone else appealed to me, and I’ve stuck
                              with the instrument ever since. I don’t think I was particularly good at it early on; I was
                               also playing piano and viola then, and I lacked the time and resolve to perfect all of
                               them. It didn’t help that an amateur clarinet sound is positively hideous, and practicing it
                               came at the expense of my family’s sanity. With persistence, however, I found that I
                               was capable of producing incredible timbres and overtones unique to the clarinet. The rich,
                               chocolatey texture is probably what I love most about the instrument.
                        </p>
                        <p>I have two people to thank: my teacher, Jessica Popik, and my middle school band director,
                            Karen Forrest. These mentors encouraged me to push my boundaries to the limit, and I
                            wouldn’t be where I am today without them.</p>

                    <h2>Districts and All State</h2>
                    <p>I have participated in the Central District Music Festival since 7th grade, and I was fortunate enough
                        to be a part of the Massachusetts All-State festival in my freshman year: one of my most memorable experiences
                        to date. The guest conductor was a truly charismatic person-his enthusiasm rippled across every one 
                        of the 100+ musicians in the band room, and he cultivated a sense of community between us. We
                        performed at Symphony Hall after 3 consecutive days of nonstop practice. Seeing the conductor cut off
                        the final chord of David Maslanka’s "Give Us This Day" with a triumphant smile gave me a feeling of exhilaration 
                        that I don’t think I’ll ever be able to recreate. I returned to the All-State Festival again in sophomore year, 
                        but the virtual experience was nowhere near as exciting as the real thing.</p>
